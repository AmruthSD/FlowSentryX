/*
Since the kernel has the following restrictions :
    (1) limitations on the quantity of eBPF instructions and stack space, 
    (2) prohibitions on unbounded loops, non-static global variables, variadic functions,
        multi-threaded programming, and floating-point representation, and 
    (3) enforcement of array bound checks

Given that all instructions must adhere to integer arithmetic, fixed-point
numbers are employed instead of floating-point numbers within eBPF
programs [39]. The maximum number of instructions within an eBPF
program is restricted to one million BPF instructions with a maximum
of 8192 jump instructions.2 The maximum stack space available for an
eBPF program is limited to 512 bytes [4], a value significantly smaller
than the user spaceâ€™s default maximum of 8192 KB for stack space.
This constraint indicates that local variables with substantial sizes are
unavailable. These constraints apply per eBPF/XDP program.
